</p>

Pastry Shop is a software used to manage the sale of desserts. Every item has a name, a price, a list of ingredients with quantity and measurement unit, availability, and dinamically changing price based on the production time.

Owners can access the back office area with email and password to manage desserts. The showcase page is accessible by everyone to view the list of desserts (with their ingredients and prices).

The website is developed with:
- Backend: PHP & Yii2
- Frontend: Bootstrap5, Tabler & jQuery

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project is that your Web server supports PHP 7.4.

<br>

INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

Then you can install composer on the root of the project using the following command:

~~~
composer install
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `pastry-shop` is the directory directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/pastry-shop/web/
~~~

<br>

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;port=8889;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.

<br>

SETUP DB
-------------

Now you can migrate up the DB with all the tables needed and with the sample data. Run the following command in the root of the project:

~~~
php yii migrate/fresh
~~~

Then confirm two times.

<br>

SERVER
-------------

If the DB is properly connected and the migrations have run, you can start the server with:

~~~
php yii serve
~~~

<br>

AUTHENTICATION
-------------

To login in the website you can use one of the two user setup by the migrations:

~~~
luana@email.it
password1234
~~~
~~~
maria@email.it
password5678
~~~
